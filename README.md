However, verifying your token will give you more visibility and increase the trust of the community.  
To get the verified, check out the [documentation](https://docs.muesliswap.com/cardano/community-tokens/token-verification) and the [Github repository](https://github.com/MuesliSwapTeam/muesliswap-token-verification)

## MuesliSwap token listing ðŸ¥£

The official repository to request a token listing @ AdaMuesliSwap

This list includes all the tokens listed at [ada.muesliswap.com](https://ada.muesliswap.com).
In order to request a coin to be listed, follow our contribution guide.

## Structure

The folder `tokens` contains [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files that describe each token listed at AdaMuesliSwap.
Each file contains information on what the coin is called, its supply and other important information.
The name of the file is the string `<policy_id>.<name>.json`.

In the folder `images`, an image is listed for each token that should be traded.
This is required so that an image can be displayed for the token on the website.
The name of the file is the string `<policy_id>.<name>.png`.
